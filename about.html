  Hello! My name is Nick. I've spent the past 8 years in San Francisco after growing up in the greater DC area. 
  I currently split my time between the Bay Area and the Bahamas with my fiance, Alice. I spend as much time outdoors as possible.
  Most of my free time is spent traveling, skiing, free diving, working out, swimming, exploring music, and spending quality time with friends.
</p>

<p>
  I am passionate about the outdoors and love to explore new places. 
  Whether it's hiking in the mountains, diving in the ocean, or skiing down a snowy slope, I find joy in every adventure.
  Recently, I spent two weeks in Hokkaido, Japan, where I skiied across the prefecture from the Niseko resort to the Asahidake backcountry.
  Japan's food and culture is some of the best in the world - not to mention the powder! I can't wait to go back.

  Lately, I have been spending time down in Long Island, Bahamas, where I have been free diving and exploring the beautiful underwater world.
  Alice and I have been working on a project to build a tiny second home on the island, which has been an exciting adventure in itself!
  She introduced me to free diving, which is my latest new passion. The serenity underwater is unparalleled, and fosters calm and relaxation, and has been shown to boost creativity.
  I find the experience of free diving to be meditative and a great way to connect with nature away from the business of the Bay Area.

  Of course, my other passions are coding, data and automation. I love telling stories with data and building tools that make work easy.
  I have a strong background in data science, analytics, and engineering. Lately, I've been working on my full-stack dev skills, so I built this website!
  I graduated from William & Mary with a BS in Applied Math (Statistics) & Economics, as well an MS in Business Analytics from their Mason School of Business.

  Professionally, I've built a career working in data, primarily in the FinTech space.
  I spent the past 3 years at Stripe on Cost Platform Technical Operations team, where I built interchange decision trees in Ruby, scheme fee models with SQL, and an internal tool with Spark, Python and Streamlit. 
  Prior, I spent close to 4 years at Marqeta on their Data Science/Analytics team, working on Finacial products and operations automations.
  My first year out of grad school was with comScore, where I built and managed webpage analytics dashboards for a couple Fortune 500 clients using SQL Server, Bash, and Excel.
